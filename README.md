# Software Renderer

A simple 3D renderer for a set of points using transformation matrices and perspective projection.
It doesn't use OpenGL nor DirectX, it calculates with matrix operations the final positions of 3D vertices to a 2D scene.

Camera controls:
* WASD - move up, left, down and right
* F/R - move forward and backward
* Q/R - roll
* Mouse - pitch/yaw

Written in Lua with [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) 0.10.1.
